## Description

Take control of your gout management with GoutGuard, the intelligent companion designed specifically for people living with gout. Using advanced AI technology, GoutGuard helps you make smarter dietary choices, track your health metrics, and stay on top of your gout management plan -- all while keeping your data completely private on your device.

**AI-POWERED FOOD SCANNING**
Simply point your camera at any meal, snack, or nutrition label, and GoutGuard's AI instantly identifies the food, estimates its purine content, and gives you a clear risk rating. Know before you eat whether a food is safe for your gout -- at home, at restaurants, or at the grocery store.

**COMPREHENSIVE PURINE DATABASE**
Browse and search our extensive database of foods with purine content levels. Each food is categorized as low, moderate, high, or very high purine, with detailed information to help you plan gout-friendly meals. Filter by category, search by name, and discover safer alternatives to your favorite foods.

**URIC ACID TRACKING**
Log your uric acid lab results and visualize trends over time with clear, easy-to-read charts. Track how your dietary choices and medications are affecting your levels. Share your history with your rheumatologist to have more informed conversations about your treatment plan.

**GOUT FLARE LOGGING**
Record gout flare events with details including affected joints, pain severity, duration, and potential triggers. Over time, identify patterns and triggers to help you and your doctor develop better prevention strategies.

**MEDICATION REMINDERS**
Never miss a dose of your gout medication. Set customizable reminders for allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, or any other medications prescribed by your doctor. Track your adherence and stay consistent with your treatment plan.

**HYDRATION TRACKING**
Staying hydrated is essential for gout management. GoutGuard makes it easy to track your daily water intake with quick-add buttons and a visual progress bar toward your daily goal. Proper hydration helps your kidneys flush uric acid more effectively.

**DAILY PURINE BUDGET**
Set a personalized daily purine intake target and monitor your consumption throughout the day with a visual progress tracker. GoutGuard helps you stay within safe limits and alerts you when you're approaching your daily cap.

**YOUR PRIVACY COMES FIRST**
All your health data is stored locally on your device. We don't require accounts, we don't track you, and we don't sell your data. Your health information is yours alone. The only data that leaves your device is food images sent for AI analysis, which are not stored on any server.
